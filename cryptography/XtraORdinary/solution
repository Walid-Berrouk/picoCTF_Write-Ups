the key to this challenge is knowing that for a specific key, no matter how much encrypt (Xor you make), it stays the same (See Test 1)

So first, we will apply a decryption using all random strs

Brute force to get the key
The idea is that throughout the randint, there are a chance that the xors applied are either odd or even, so xor applied or not. So try all possibilities
Check : https://www.ctfwriteup.com/picoctf/picomini-by-redpwn/cryptography

Instead of using random like in the write up, we generate possibilities using genBinary, then appliing xor on whenever value == 1

Then the final one will be with some lain text (picoCTF{) to get real key that the flag has been encrypted with it

Note : 
 - the decryption is the encryption itself (See Test 2), we can use also xor method from pwn (Check import)
 - Since 'ever' string is repeated, we can apply it only once, the same result will be repeated
