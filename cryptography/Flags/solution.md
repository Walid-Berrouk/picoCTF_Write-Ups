## Write-Up

After looking a bit about flag numbers and all, we can find that those flags are actually marine signals, See `marine_signals.png` or `nfcs0__3.png`. We can use those images to decrypt the flag.

```
PICOCTF{F AG AND TUFF}
```

After some guessing :

```
PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}
```

## Flag

PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}
