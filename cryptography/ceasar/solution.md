Since the name of the challenge, the cipher used is the ceasar cipher.

The idea of the crypto cipher is to make shifts in ords of the alphabt.

To solve it, we need to make all shifts possible and test them, it will be only 26 possible combinations

you can find the `script.py` that generates all possible outputs.

After testing, the fourth one is the flag.

flag : picoCTF{crossingtherubiconvfhsjkou}
