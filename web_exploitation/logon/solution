When you enter the challenge, you will get a form for login

targetting the route `/logout` with get request will download the htnl file `lnVnIR2u.html`, that says only that the nginx engine is used.
targetting the route `/login` with get request will send `Bad request` message.

login with user : `admin` and password : `admin` or any other user (random user and password) logs you in, but displays no flag, the flag is probably in the user : `Joe` account

Challene name : logon

Note : In nontechnical web parlance, log on often means to visit (especially a website), and log in means to sign in with a username and password. For example, we could say you logged on to this website simply by visiting this page, but you won't be logging in because nothing on this site requires a username and password.

You can see clearly that it checks only for Joe's user, otherzise will let you directly in.

Unfortunatly, we don't have access to backend scripts, so we can see with what is it checking it with

But when we check for cookies, we can see that is setted some cookies for each user you login with, one of the important cookies (See `Cookies.png`) :
```
admin: False
password: admin
username: admin
```

Appearantly, it checks for cookies before displaying the right page, so if we change admin field to `True`, and then refresh, it will get that cookie and depending on the its value, displays the flag or not !

This is called gain admin access by Cookies manipulation, it is a security proble, which extends any inormation provided to the client. So, never trust data that come from the admin.
