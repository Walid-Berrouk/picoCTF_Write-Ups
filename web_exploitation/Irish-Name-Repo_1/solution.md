## Description

> There is a website running at [Link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50009/). Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

## Hints

> There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this. I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
>
> Try to think about how the website verifies your login.

## Write-Up

When accessing a website, we can find a list of profiles displayed in the page : 

<img src="./1.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="
     width: 80%;
     diplay: box;"
/>

When we open this site, we see the content of the main page is not very helpful. When we look at the Support page however, we see an inquiry saying `Hi. I tried adding my favorite Irish person, Conan O'Brien. But I keep getting something called a SQL Error`. This tells us that the site uses a SQL database.

In the menu, we can see that there is a admin login portal. Let's explore it and see what is hides.

<img src="./2.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="
     width: 80%;
     diplay: box;"
/>

It seems like it is a normal login portal :

<img src="./3.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="
     width: 80%;
     diplay: box;"
/>

Let's curl it to get the action route and name fields (we can check those in the console as well) :

<img src="./4.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="
     width: 80%;
     diplay: box;"
/>

From the hints of the challenge and what we found, we may suspect that the login system is vulnerable to **SQL Injections**, let's try to make a basic injection what it does :

```
curl 'https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50009/login.php' --X POST --data "username=' OR 1=1 -- &password="
```

Indeed, it was vulnerable to **SQLi** :

```html
<h1>Logged in!</h1><p>Your flag is: picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_fb3fe2ad}</p>
```

What is happening here is the query checks if the username is equal to nothing. Then, it checks OR 1=1. Since 1 is always going to be equal to 1, this returns true. The -- at the end simply comments out the rest of the query. This fools the server into letting us through the portal.


## Flag

picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_fb3fe2ad}
