# Forbidden Paths

## Write-Up

From the description of the flag, we can get the following information :

 - The website is using absolute paths filtering, which means that we can't access to the top level directories using absolute paths (like `/flag.txt`)
 - Files are in the `/usr/share/nginx/html/`
 - Flag is in the root folder (`/`)

When checking the website, we can find the following :

 - `read.php` takes submitted path and displays the content if it is a file, and prints `Not Authorized` if we try accessing files using absolute paths.

But we can try to use relative paths in order to access files, like when using `../`, it will show nothing since it is a directory, but it doesn't print `Not Authoried` message either.

Our job is the to find the relative path from `/usr/share/nginx/html/` that will take us to the `flag.txt` :

```
../../../../flag.txt
```
