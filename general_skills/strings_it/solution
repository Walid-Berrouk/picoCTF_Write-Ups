With the given file `strings`, we need to check the type of it :

```
┌──(rivench㉿kali)-[~/Documents/picoCTF/strings_it]
└─$ file strings 
strings: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=94ec6b5e9cef175e834e0f7fcaedeaa167603c90, not stripped
```

It seems like an executable file, but the description says not to run it (running it doesn't work anyway), but search for the flag without running it.

what checking the file using `cat strings`, you can find some text strings that are readable, so we might thing that the flag is hidden inside the file.

To search for it, we will search for the string 'picoCTF{' and see if it is available, we can use :

`grep 'picoCTF{' --text strings`

(--text since the file is binary and we want him to consider the binary as text)

the string part of the flag will be highlighted is red in output (search for it since the file is all concatinated together).

Flag : picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_d66c7bb7}

(You can use the command `strings` which prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long to view the flag :
    `strings strings | grep 'picoCTF{'`
)
