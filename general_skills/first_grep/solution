from the title of the challenge, we can conclude that the command `grep` will be used to search for the flag in the provided file `file`


when looking for file type, we can see that it is a text file :

```zsh
└─$ file file   
file: ASCII text, with very long lines (4200)
```

so, to search for the flag, we will search for the obvious part of it which is `picoCTF{`, the flag will be diplayed after it :

`grep 'picoCTF{' file `

flag : picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_f77e0797}
